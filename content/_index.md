# Cognito Workshop

### Overview

In this workshop, we’ll explore Amazon Cognito and learn how to use this service in our project. We’ll start from scratch—writing code and setting up Cognito to integrate it into the project we’ve built.

Beyond Cognito, we’ll also set up a few other applications to clarify the purpose of using Cognito and to achieve the goals of this workshop.
